Stephen Lynch's talk on &quot;Maths is fun&quot; was extremely well delivered
and proved to be highly popular with our students; there was standing room only
for late comers. He delivered his talk in a clear lively manner and illustrated
his points using an assortment of visual aids from the lowly video cassette to
AIBO the robotic dog. The audience found the presentation interesting and
informative. Some memorable facts that students responded to were:- the concept
that time varied in deep space they found astounding, the existence of
non-Euclidean geometry was consider unsettling and others found fractals and
there use in the modelling of the reproduction of flies inventive . The staff
were fascinated by the process of obtaining an international patent. The entire
audience was taken with AIBO; some students (and staff) regretted not taking up
Dr Lynch's offer to play with the dog.' 'At the end of the lecture students were left with
a better understanding of the impact that mathematics plays in the everyday
world. They also realised that their options with mathematics at university
could be wider than they first thought. Our students would recommend this
enjoyable talk to their friends and word of mouth is the best advertisement and
endorsement there is'.<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></span></p>

Maths talk and again thoroughly enjoyed it, finding it very relevant and
exciting. All the teachers that came to listen gave excellent feedback. It is always difficult to find good speakers and
interesting lectures for Mathematics. Yours was both and I would like to invite

learnt from the workshop how maths is applied in real life and was surprised by
the range of topics in maths taught at university. It
has made me reconsider taking maths at A-level as it was really
different/interesting from maths in school and I realise jobs prefer maths over
anything else. 'The talk and workshop provided was fantastic. Students were engaged throughout and
